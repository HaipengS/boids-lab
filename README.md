# Boids Lab

An interactive, web-based simulation of flocking behavior based on the
classic Boids model. This project explores how simple local interaction
rules give rise to complex emergent group behavior.

## Features
- Separation, alignment, and cohesion rules
- Real-time parameter tuning
- Interactive visualization using HTML5 Canvas
- Designed for extensibility (predators, wind, perching behavior)

## Live Demo
🚧 Coming soon (GitHub Pages)

## Project Motivation
This project was built to study emergence in agent-based systems and to
provide an intuitive, visual way to experiment with flocking dynamics.
